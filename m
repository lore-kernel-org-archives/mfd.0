This series adds support for the NXP P3H2x4x family of multi-port I3C
hub devices, including their on-die regulators and downstream I3C/SMBus
target ports.

The series introduces:
- Core I3C master enhancements required for hub support
- Generic I3C hub framework
- MFD driver with regulator and I3C hub child drivers for the P3H2x4x I3C hub

The dependency order within the series is:

- Patches 1 and 2 provide the I3C core helpers required by the generic
  I3C hub framework
- Patch 3 provides the P3H2x4x Device Tree binding
- Patch 4 provides the MFD parent required by both the regulator and
  P3H2x4x I3C hub child drivers
- Patch 5 provides the regulator child driver and depends on patch 4
- Patch 6 provides the generic I3C hub framework and depends on the
  I3C core changes in patches 1 and 2
- Patch 7 provides the P3H2x4x I3C hub child driver and depends on
  patches 4 and 6
- Patch 8 extends the P3H2x4x hub driver with SMBus slave mode support
  and depends on patch 7

Changes in v20:
- Rebased the series onto v7.3-rc4
- Moved the generic I3C hub MAINTAINERS entries from patch 6 to patch 7,
  allowing patches 1, 2 and 6 to be applied independently of the P3H2x4x
  driver
- No functional driver changes
- Link to v19: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i3c/20260916070728.1088801-1-lakshay.piplani@nxp.com/T/#u

Changes in v19:
- Rebased the series onto v7.3-rc3
- Expressed P3H2440, P3H2441 and P3H2841 using nxp,p3h2840 as their
  fallback compatible in the DT binding
- Reworked the binding description to contain hardware details only
- Updated the binding example to demonstrate the fallback-compatible form
- Retained only nxp,p3h2840 in the MFD driver's OF match table
- Link to v18: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i3c/20260903062108.2712296-1-lakshay.piplani@nxp.com/T/#u

Changes in v18:
- Rebased onto v7.3-rc1; no intended driver behaviour changes
- Adapted i3c_master_register_fwnode() to the generic fwnode handling
  introduced in v7.3-rc1
- Link to v17: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i3c/20260902102929.2268307-1-lakshay.piplani@nxp.com/T/#u

Changes in v17:
- Document the calling context of i3c_dev_recycle_ibi_slot_controller():
  it runs in workqueue context without the bus lock held, while the 
  controller owns and synchronizes its IBI pool
- Retain the request_ibi capability check to preserve the pre-series
  behaviour for regular I3C devices
- Explain in the binding description that all variants share the same register
  interface, software reads the target-port count from DEV_CAPAB, and
  the x0/x1 variants differ only in power-up defaults that the driver
  overrides
- Remove the fixed post-enable delay; regulator settling is now handled
  by the regulator core
- Add .enable_time = 5000 through P3H2X4X_LDO_ENABLE_TIME_US to all four
  LDO descriptors, so the regulator core applies the post-enable
  settling delay
- Move the lockdep-only routing-lock class assignment into a dedicated
  helper, leaving hub context initialization unconditional when
  CONFIG_LOCKDEP is disabled
- Document that hub_dev must already be registered and remove the
  WARN_ON_ONCE checks for its descriptor and parent controller
- Export i3c_hub_master_ops as a const object and reference it directly
  instead of returning it through an accessor
- Document that downstream ports share the parent controller's dynamic
  address domain and that independent per-port DAA domains are not
  provided
- Document that a broadcast CCC on a virtual bus reaches the parent bus
  and devices behind other connected ports; directed CCCs must be used
  for per-device scope
- Document that fixed-DT address reservations remain allocated for the
  lifetime of the parent bus, are reused across driver reprobes, and
  that downstream hot-join support would also require reserving static
  addresses
- Use a named initializer for the platform_device_id table
- Document why I3C target ports are connected once and left connected,
  making their per-operation enable and disable callbacks no-ops
- Reference the exported i3c_hub_master_ops object directly
- Link to v16: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i3c/20260826103819.1614843-1-lakshay.piplani@nxp.com/T/#u

Changes in v16:
- Rename the controller-only helpers with a "_locked" suffix to
  make the parent-bus locking contract explicit, route IBI slot recycling
  through the controller helper, and destroy the generic IBI workqueue when
  request_ibi() fails
- Fix a lockdep "recursive locking" false positive on the hub forwarding path
  by giving the virtual bus lock and hub routing mutex per-nesting-depth
  lockdep classes
- Fix parent-bus dynamic-address reservation to reserve by assigned-address
  and only when the slot is free, avoiding ENTDAA collisions
- Make downstream reattach atomic against asynchronous IBI and reject it while
  an IBI is live; detach IBI-lifetime invariant documented and checked with
  WARN_ON_ONCE; underlying core IBI teardown fix deferred (known I3C-core
  limitation)
- Tighten the target-port reg schema (explicit minimum 0, maximum 7, and
  maximum 3 for four-port variants)
- Do not ignore regulator-enable failures during hub configuration
- Widen the SMBus poll deadline to the datasheet SDA-stuck/SCL-low recovery
  window and use DMA-safe buffers for controller-agent and SMBus-agent
  transfers over I3C
- Advertise I2C_FUNC_SLAVE only when CONFIG_I2C_SLAVE is enabled, reject slave
  registration unless the upstream I3C device and IBI path are available, and
  always clear the software slave state on unregister
- Validate the SMBus-agent IBI payload length and bound the target-port loop
  by num_target_ports before dispatching receive events
- Link to v15: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i3c/20260817103844.2142802-1-lakshay.piplani@nxp.com/T/#u

Changes in v15:
- Replace the direct attach and detach APIs with controller-only helpers
  that do not modify address-slot state, device lists or generic IBI
  lifecycle state
- Add controller-only helpers for device attach, reattach and detach,
  and for requesting, freeing, enabling, disabling and recycling IBI
  resources
- Rework the generic hub architecture to keep downstream logical device
  descriptors associated with their virtual controllers
- Add a permanent parent-facing descriptor for each downstream device
  and use it for operations handled by the physical parent controller
- Remove temporary descriptor reparenting and temporary hub dynamic
  address replacement from downstream transfer paths
- Forward downstream private transfers and the complete IBI lifecycle,
  including IBI slot recycling, through the parent-facing descriptor
  with appropriate parent-bus locking
- Add binding and MFD support for the P3H2440, P3H2441, P3H2840 and
  P3H2841 variants
- Fix the target-port reg schema and update the binding examples to use
  SMBus target-port nodes
- Read the device capability register to determine whether the device
  provides four or eight target ports
- Configure and register only the target ports implemented by the
  selected device variant
- Preserve the MFD parent's driver data and store the hub context in the
  shared MFD structure for use by IBI callbacks
- Validate target-port types and indices while ignoring non-target-port
  children, such as the regulators node, during Device Tree parsing
- Correct the SMBus transfer timeout calculation for 400 kHz operation
- Use I2C adapter quirks to enforce the maximum supported read and write
  payload lengths
- Publish callback-visible SMBus adapter state before adapter
  registration and roll it back if registration fails
- Rework SMBus slave registration and unregistration to use the shared
  protected-register lock and update software state only after the
  corresponding hardware operation succeeds
- Update the MFD source description to identify the device as an NXP
  P3H2x4x multi-port I3C hub instead of referring to it as an "MFD
  device driver"
- Link to v14: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i3c/20260714092053.2461482-1-lakshay.piplani@nxp.com/T/#u

Changes in v14:
- Add i3c_master_register_fwnode() for virtual I3C masters and use it instead of temporarily changing
  parent dev->of_node
- Add runtime PM handling in i3c_master_send_ccc_cmd()
- Export i3c_bus_maintenance_lock()/unlock() and use them in hub paths
- Fix IBI request/free cleanup to handle forwarded callbacks that clear dev->ibi, and destroy the
  allocated IBI workqueue on request failure
- Add a shared MFD protected_reg_lock and use it for protected register accesses across P3H2X4X
  child drivers
- Rework regulator protected-register handling to restore the original protection state after
  each operation
- Serialize hub route selection around DAA, CCC, private transfer and IBI paths
- Hold the parent maintenance lock across temporary hub address reattach, transfer and address
  restore
- Fix SMBus polling interval calculation
- Clean up already registered SMBus adapters on adapter allocation or registration failure
- Fix SMBus slave receive status handling by clearing receive flags on error paths, using FIELD_GET()
  and explicitly clearing overflow status
- Link to v13: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i3c/20260701065755.2067793-1-lakshay.piplani@nxp.com/T/#u

Changes in v13:
- Fix I3C master address management in direct attach/detach paths by using i3c_master_get_i3c_addrs()
  adding rollback on failure, skipping master self attach/detach, and properly releasing addresses to
  avoid stale state and use-after-free issues.
- Export and document address slot helper APIs for I3C hub support.
- Reserve parent bus address slots for downstream devices with identical static and assigned addresses
  by parsing target-port DT nodes prior to virtual controller registration, preventing DAA conflicts.
- Keep broadcast RSTDAA blocked with added documentation, and clarify intentional no-op callbacks
  and pending TODOs (e.g., IBI slot recycle).
- Rework SMBus transaction handling to use polling instead of fixed delays
  avoiding premature reads and data corruption.
- Fix DT handling issues by preventing duplicate target-port node leaks and restoring dev->of_node
  after temporary modification.
- Improve resource management using devm-based cleanup for DT nodes, IBI setup, adapter unregister
  and register relock paths.
- Make IBI setup optional and robust to avoid probe failures on unsupported platforms, with proper cleanup.
- Fix SMBus slave receive path by improving buffer handling, event delivery, and handling of unregistered ports.
- Strengthen concurrency handling with proper locking around shared state.
- Link to v12: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i3c/20260617110355.1591844-1-lakshay.piplani@nxp.com/T/#u
