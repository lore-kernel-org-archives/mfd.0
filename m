I’m deeply sorry for the delayed response due to personal reasons.

Regarding Patch-1, I don’t mind using your current version as is—it’s 
more complete. However, I received another email from lkp[1] a few days 
ago, and I still hope this patch can be merged sooner.

The current discussion is focused on the GPIO-related patch, but in 
reality, it isn’t closely tied to the other patches; it’s more of an 
optimization. If possible, I personally think we could set it aside for 
now and treat it as a separate set of feature optimization patches.
