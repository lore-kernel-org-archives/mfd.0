TRM describing the hardware. It's available online [1].

[1] - https://doc-en.rvspace.org/JH7110/TRM/

They already are: the hdmi subsystem is patch 11, the vout subsystem
patch 12 and the Innosilicon helpers patch 15. They go out as one
series because they depend on each other - the DT in patch 18 needs all
three drivers - and the tree has to build at every commit, so they
cannot land separately.

Thanks for the review, I have picked up your Reviewed-by on the patches
that did not change in v4. A Tested-by once your board arrives would be
very welcome.
