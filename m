I can see that but the parameters for these (rather dubious) previous
behaviours are now being copied into the devicetree bindings where they
become stable ABI.

This behaviour does not match the devicetree bindings documentation for
max-brightness:

  Normally the maximum brightness is determined by the hardware and this
  property is not required. This property is used to put a software limit
  on the brightness apart from what the driver says, as it could happen
  that a LED can be made so bright that it gets damaged or causes damage
  due to restrictions in a specific system, such as mounting conditions.

Hence the question, why is the current behaviour useful?

If I understand your summary correctly the hardware has 32 steps
including 0) and the effect of max_current is to ban all brightness
values greater than max_current / AAT2870_CURRENT_STEP.

If that is the case then max_brightness if fundamentally broken because
it's default value offers more steps than exists in the hardware.
bd->props.max_brightness should be set to max_current /
AAT2870_CURRENT_STEP and the whole of aat2870_brightness() should be
removed (use backlight_get_brightness() instead).

IMHO the patchset will be cleaner if the weird max_brightness logic is
removed in a separate before doing the DT changes.
