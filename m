Nope. Thank You for taking the time to do the review - and read my replies!

I see your point :) I am not intending to "completely hide" these 
properties from the reviewers. Please, see below.

I am patching them. I, however, am not planning to delete the properties 
completely (the comment above about not hiding properties from 
reviewers). For example, the bd71815 and bd71828, do not support (at 
least all) of the OTP configured pins which are also declared here. 
Thus, I don't want to allow those unsupported pin properties for them.

My plan is to keep the "additionalProperties: false", and require the 
supported properties to be explicitly listed in the 
rohm,bd71828-pmic.yaml and rohm,bd72720-pmic.yaml. And, when the types, 
descriptions, and allowed values (when common for all PMICs) are in the 
referenced file, the rohm,bdXXXX-pmic.yaml can become quite simple:

rohm,clkout-open-drain: true;

Enough to remind reviewers that there is legacy - and allow reviewers as 
well as authors to re-evaluate the properties - while also pointing out 
that this is existing stuff. (And allow validator scripts to catch use 
of unsupported common properties - at least if this works as I think it 
does).

I somehow thought it'd be clearer to split the changes in own patches - 
but I am fully Ok with squashing these if it is preferred way.

In case of the "rohm,clkout-open-drain" - AFAIR it is not used from new 
drivers, but the new PMICs which are added, are supported by the same 
MFD driver. I am not too keen on changing the property values in this 
driver (because it'd require every user to update their dtses - which 
feels like a source of problems). Nor am I too excited about supporting 
old and new values in this driver as it makes the driver (in my opinion 
unnecessarily) more complex.

What comes to using something else for completely new designs - I'd say 
(a bit cautiously) that changing the properties there is fine. 
Cautiously because it is still dancing between "what users have used to 
see" Vs. "what feels like best course of action - Today" ;) Cautiously 
also because we don't probably want to support multiple vendor specific 
properties for same purpose - at least not in a long run.

Yours,

Ps, planning to join ELCE/Plumbers this year? It'd be about a time to 
meet you in person :)
