Changes in v20:
 - Move the generic I3C hub MAINTAINERS entries to patch 7, allowing this
   patch to be applied independently of the P3H2x4x driver

Changes in v19:
 - No change

Changes in v18:
 - Rebased onto v7.3-rc1; no intended driver behaviour changes

Changes in v17:
 - Move the lockdep-only routing-lock class assignment into a dedicated
   helper, leaving hub context initialization unconditional when
   CONFIG_LOCKDEP is disabled
 - Document that hub_dev must already be registered and remove the
   WARN_ON_ONCE checks for its descriptor and parent controller
 - Export i3c_hub_master_ops as a const object and reference it directly
   instead of returning it through an accessor
 - Document that downstream ports share the parent controller's dynamic
   address domain and that independent per-port DAA domains are not
   provided
 - Document that a broadcast CCC on a virtual bus reaches the parent bus
   and devices behind other connected ports; directed CCCs must be used
   for per-device scope
 - Document that fixed-DT address reservations remain allocated for the
   lifetime of the parent bus, are reused across driver reprobes, and
   that downstream hot-join support would also require reserving static
   addresses

Changes in v16:
 - Fix the lockdep "recursive locking" false positive on the forwarding path
   (holding the virtual bus lock while taking the parent bus lock, both
   sharing one class). Introduce per-nesting-depth lock_class_key arrays for
   the bus lock and the routing mutex, computed via
   i3c_hub_controller_depth(), assigned in i3c_hub_master_bus_init() and
   i3c_hub_init()
 - Fix the parent-bus dynamic-address reservation: reserve by
   "assigned-address" regardless of the static address (the old
   static_addr != assigned_addr skip left addresses free and risked ENTDAA
   collisions). Reserve only when the slot is currently FREE, under the
   parent bus maintenance lock
 - Make the reattach info update atomic w.r.t. asynchronous IBI: update
   parent_desc.info under i3c_bus_maintenance_lock(&parent->bus) and reject
   reattach with -EBUSY (WARN_ON_ONCE) while parent_desc.ibi is live
 - Document and check the detach-time IBI lifecycle invariant:
   parent_desc.ibi must already have been cleared through i3c_hub_free_ibi()
   before the parent-facing descriptor is detached and freed. Add
   WARN_ON_ONCE() to detect a violation. The underlying generic I3C-core
   unregister/IBI-quiesce behaviour is a known I3C-core limitation
 - Document that DAA is intentionally run on the parent controller because
   downstream devices share the parent's dynamic-address space; broadcast
   RSTDAA is intentionally not forwarded (would reset the hub address)

Changes in v15:
 - Replace temporary descriptor reparenting and hub-address switching with
   a permanent parent-facing descriptor for each downstream I3C device
 - Keep the logical device descriptor associated with the virtual hub
   controller while using the parent-facing descriptor for physical
   controller operations
 - Implement downstream device attach, reattach and detach using the new
   controller-only helpers
 - Forward IBI slot recycling to the physical parent controller
 - Remove the helper that temporarily changed the logical descriptor's
   master pointer

Changes in v14:
 - Add hub route serialization around DAA, CCC, private transfer and IBI paths
 - Add comments explaining that downstream devices behind hub target ports
   share the parent controller address space
 - Use i3c_bus_maintenance_lock()/unlock() instead of raw parent bus lock
   operations
 - Hold the parent maintenance lock across temporary hub address reattach,
   transfer and address restore
 - Rework IBI request/free forwarding, so downstream devices are temporarily
   attached to the parent controller for IBI setup
 - Clean up the preallocated virtual IBI object and workqueue before forwarding
   the IBI request to the parent controller
 - Avoid NULL dereference in the core IBI free path when the forwarding
   callback has already cleared dev->ibi

Changes in v13:
 - Reserve parent I3C bus address slots for downstream devices with matching static and
   assigned addresses by parsing target-port DT nodes
 - Keep broadcast RSTDAA blocked and add explanatory comment
 - Add TODO for empty IBI slot recycle callback
 - Add comments for intentional no-op callbacks

Changes in v12:
 - Drop redundant depends on I3C from config I3C_HUB
 - Return -EOPNOTSUPP for unsupported I2C transfers instead of reporting
   success.

Changes in v11:
 - Fix virtual hub address reattach handling
 - Fix parent bus locking during address reattach operations
 - Improve transfer and IBI request error handling

Changes in v10:
 - Remove unnecessary ibi_lock handling in request/enable/disable/free
   IBI APIs
 - Remove redundant parent pointer from struct i3c_hub and derive upstream
   master from hub_dev

Changes in v9:
 - No change

Changes in v8:
 - No change

Changes in v7:
 - Convert Kconfig option to tristate
 - Fix signedness issue in return value
 - Fix kernel-doc warnings

Changes in v6:
 - Add support for the generic I3C interface in the I3C Hub
